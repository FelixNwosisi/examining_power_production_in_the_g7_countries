## Examining Power Production in the G7 Countries

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global energy production, focusing on power generation within the Group of Seven (G7) nations. With a particular emphasis on renewable energy, this research utilizes advanced statistical and analytical techniques to delve into the complexities of energy dynamics.

### Methodology

The study employs machine learning models, including Ridge and Lasso regressors for analyzing renewable energy demand and consumption, and Sarima for time series forecasting. These models enable precise predictions of future energy trends. Notably, when compared to actual 2018 and 2019 data, the models demonstrated remarkable accuracy, with percentage differences ranging from 0-1% for regression and 0-10% for Sarima.

### Key Findings

Canada emerges as the frontrunner in renewable energy generation among the G7 nations. By leveraging insights gleaned from the analysis, this project aims to provide valuable guidance for policymakers and stakeholders in the remaining six G7 nations. The goal is to foster collaboration towards a sustainable and environmentally conscious approach to power generation.

### Implications

This research not only identifies challenges but also lays the groundwork for informed strategies, guiding the G7 nations towards a shared vision of a more sustainable and environmentally responsible energy future.
